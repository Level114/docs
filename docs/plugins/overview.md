# Plugin Overview<span class="terminal-cursor">:~$</span>

Level114 plugins are essential components that enable miners to collect and report server performance metrics to the Level114 collector service. These plugins run on various server types and provide standardized metric collection across the decentralized infrastructure network.

## How Plugins Work

Level114 plugins operate as monitoring and reporting agents that:

1. **Collect Server Metrics**: Gather comprehensive performance data including player counts, system resources, uptime, and server-specific statistics
2. **Report to Collector**: Send periodic reports to the Level114 collector service using authenticated API calls
3. **Enable Validation**: Provide validators with reliable data to assess server quality and performance
4. **Generate Revenue**: Allow miners to earn rewards based on their server's performance and reliability

## Plugin Architecture

All Level114 plugins follow a consistent architecture:

### Core Components

- **Metric Collection**: Automated gathering of server performance data
- **Report Builder**: Formats collected data into standardized reports
- **API Client**: Secure communication with the Level114 collector service
- **Configuration**: Server credentials and reporting settings

### Data Collection

Plugins typically collect:

- **Player Metrics**: Active players, maximum capacity, player activity patterns
- **System Resources**: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O
- **Network Performance**: Connection quality, latency, bandwidth usage
- **Server Health**: Uptime, error rates, stability metrics
- **Custom Metrics**: Server-type specific performance indicators

### Security Features

- **Authenticated Reporting**: Each plugin uses unique server credentials
- **Data Integrity**: Reports are cryptographically signed and hashed
- **Secure Communication**: All data transmission uses HTTPS with proper authentication
- **Nonce Protection**: Prevents replay attacks with time-limited nonces

## Plugin Installation

### Finding Level114 Plugins

All Level114 plugins are available in the subnet repository:

```
subnet/
├── plugins/
│   ├── monitor-plugin/          # Minecraft monitoring plugin (active)
│   ├── monetization-plugin/     # Minecraft monetization plugin (in development)
│   └── README.md               # Setup and configuration guide
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Download Plugin**: Get the latest JAR from subnet/plugins/ directory
2. **Server Compatibility**: Ensure your Minecraft server runs Bukkit/Paper 1.20+
