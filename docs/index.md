# Level114 - First Gaming Subnet on Bittensor<span class="terminal-cursor">:~$</span>

## What is Level114?

Level114 is the **first gaming subnet on Bittensor**, pioneering decentralized gaming infrastructure validation. Starting with Minecraft servers, Level114 validates server performance and quality while providing monetization tools for server operators, paving the way for the future of decentralized gaming networks.

### The Core Architecture

**Gaming Infrastructure Validation**: Minecraft server operators register with Level114, install monitoring plugins, and earn TAO rewards based on server performance and player engagement. The system validates server quality through decentralized assessment.

## How It Works

### For Minecraft Server Operators (Miners)
- **Run Minecraft Server**: Operate Bukkit/Paper servers with Level114 plugin integration
- **Register Infrastructure**: One-time registration with Level114 collector service
- **Install Monitoring Plugin**: Automated performance tracking and secure reporting
- **Earn TAO Rewards**: Get rewarded based on server quality, uptime, and player engagement

### For Validators  
- **Monitor Network**: Query Level114 collector service for registered miners and their metrics
- **Evaluate Performance**: Assess server quality based on uptime, performance, and reliability metrics
- **Set Weights**: Distribute TAO rewards based on objective performance criteria
- **Maintain Standards**: Ensure the gaming network maintains high infrastructure quality

### Level114 Collector Service
- **Operated by Level114**: Central registry maintained by the Level114 team at `collector.level114.io`
- **Server Registration**: Accepts and verifies server registrations from miners
- **Metrics Collection**: Stores performance reports and Minecraft server data
- **Validator API**: Provides authenticated access to server data for network validators

## Quick Start

### I Want to Run a Minecraft Server (Miner)
Register your Minecraft server infrastructure and start earning TAO rewards:

1. Set up your Minecraft server (Bukkit/Paper 1.20+) with public access
2. Install the Level114 subnet software
3. Run the miner to register with collector service  
4. Install and configure the monitoring plugin on your Minecraft server
5. Start earning TAO based on server performance and player activity

### I Want to Run a Validator
Help maintain gaming network quality by validating Minecraft server performance:

1. Set up your validator node with Bittensor wallet
2. Configure Level114 collector service access  
3. Start querying miners and setting weights based on server quality
4. Earn TAO rewards for maintaining network standards
