# Level114 - First Gaming Subnet on Bittensor<span class="terminal-cursor">:~$</span>

## What is Level114?

Level114 is the **first gaming subnet on Bittensor**, we aims to bring decentralized gaming to life. We support gaming experiences—not only by validating game servers, but also by rewarding hosts, developers, and players for quality, performance, and community engagement. With Level114, everyone wins when the game plays well, is fair, and grows together.

### Key pillars of what Level114 delivers:

- Uses Bittensor's subnet framework to connect to a wider, token-incentivized network, so rewards, validation, and growth are tied to real performance.

- Measures things players and hosts care about—uptime, speed, stability, fairness—and uses those metrics to guide rewards and trust.

- Gives game creators, server hosts, and communities tools to profit: not just from access or fees, but from delivering great experiences that people want.

- Open, clear rules and metrics: everyone knows how things are tested, how rewards are given, and how to improve.

- Built to scale across different game types and platforms, so soon we'll support more than just one game—expanding into new genres, styles, and ways to play.

## First Game: Minecraft

We're launching with **Minecraft**. In this phase, Minecraft games and servers are validated for quality and performance. Hosts get access to reward tools tied to things like uptime, stability, and player satisfaction, premium players hosted. This first game establishes the standard for what players and hosts can expect—and sets the stage for Level114 to bring the same energy and structure to many more games.

## How It Works

### For Minecraft Server Operators (Miners)
- **Run Minecraft Server**: Operate Bukkit/Paper servers with Level114 plugin integration
- **Register Infrastructure**: One-time registration with Level114 collector service
- **Install Monitoring Plugin**: Automated performance tracking and secure reporting
- **Earn TAO Rewards**: Get rewarded based on server quality, uptime, and player engagement

### For Validators  
- **Monitor Network**: Query Level114 collector service for registered miners and their metrics
- **Evaluate Performance**: Assess server quality based on uptime, performance, and reliability metrics
- **Set Weights**: Distribute TAO rewards based on objective performance criteria
- **Maintain Standards**: Ensure the gaming network maintains high infrastructure quality

### Level114 Collector Service
- **Operated by Level114**: Central registry maintained by the Level114 team at `collector.level114.io`
- **Server Registration**: Accepts and verifies server registrations from miners
- **Metrics Collection**: Stores performance reports and Minecraft server data
- **Validator API**: Provides authenticated access to server data for network validators
